# W.I.P
## This is the store frontend of Toolpacks, and it will become the store frontend of AppBundleHUB soon.
### This is a disaster. Its still better than the single-file script.js I wrote which contained the entire website's logic.
### It is my first time using BS technologies since a long time, I hadn't ever used a bundler either.
### Lots of this is AI-gen, since I wanted to split my 600 lines script.js into smaller files but wasn't able to do it because of something something CORS, etc
