### Automatically built AppBundles that run on Musl && Glibc Linux

- Built using one-liner recipes, thanks to [pelfCreator](https://github.com/xplshn/pelf/tree/master/cmd/pelfCreator)

- With a web store (poorly built because I do not know JS/HTML)

- Can be self-hosted, recipes are easy to add, and everything has logs and its on Github
